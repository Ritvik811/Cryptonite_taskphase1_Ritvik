# File Globbing Module
This is an interesting module as i didn't know what globbing was before so it was a new concept. 
The challenges were easy except **pondering paths** as I passed the argument as /home/hacker/challenge/files but quickly realised my mistake and changed it to /challenge/files.
Mixing globs was a bit tough but manageble once it prompted me to use [].
