## Setting path 
Here we learn to set PATH so that we can easliy run commands without their paths for easier execution

## Adding commands
here i see where the cat command is stored which is in usr/bin. So i add win directory to PATH.

## Hijacking commands
Here i create a file rm and use cat in it overiding the rm commands actual function. I chnage the permissions and change the path to where rm is located so when /challenge/run runs rm it'll actually cat the flag out
