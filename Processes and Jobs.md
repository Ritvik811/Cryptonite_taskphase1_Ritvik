Here we learn how to kill processes running in a deafult way which allows the process to terminate properly. I grep out the processes to get the ppd and then kill it.

## Process exit codes
we see how to get exit codes to previously run commands. the codes get stored in **?**. we read the variable to get our exit codes. If a program runs well we get 0 and if it has an error its usually 1 or any other error code corresponding to what has gone wrong
