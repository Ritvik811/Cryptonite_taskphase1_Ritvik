# Pondering Paths module
since i have used ubuntu before i do have a little idea about the file system in linux and the CLI commands such as cd, ls, rm, mkdir etc

coming to the module it was pretty basic module. i knew the concepts before but i didn't know terms like **Relative Path** and **Absolute Path**
which was new to me. I unnecessarly spend 5 mins on "Home Sweet Home" module because of the 3 characters or less rule.
