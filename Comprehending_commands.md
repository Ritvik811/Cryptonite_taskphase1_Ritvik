# Comprehending Commands module
This was a fun module as i did learn a few commands which i wasn't aware of before like **cat**, **grep**, **ls** but with -a.

linking was a new concept and the **find** exercise was fun

## cat: not the pet but the command 
Here we learnt to use the cat command. It concatinates or reads the file
**flag: pwn.college{gnUtoENCe0pVZ1dIk4QxUQhgR6m.dFzN1QDLwUTO0czW}**

## cating absolute paths
Here we get the flag by using 'cat /flag' invoking the flag using it's absolute path
**flag: pwn.college{YS0zJnjVQbbGDu8S_IczIK5_pGc.dlTM5QDLwUTO0czW}**

## More catting practice
Here we just use another path specified

## Greping for a needle in a hay stack 
grep command is used to seach a file. here we use it to search our flag.

## lisiting files 
here we use ls command to list files.

## Touching files
Here we use the touch command to create files. 
**flag: pwn.college{QaV8L0mGB223x14xoZxJien6BS6.dBzM4QDLwUTO0czW}**

## Removing files 
Here we use the rm to remove files and run /challenge/check to get the flag 
**flag: pwn.college{sj6FsF3pzWyGYHtL__JTNJDl_PY.dZTOwUDLwUTO0czW}**

## Hidden files
some files aren't shown in linux when we use ls, so we use also use '-a' to get the hidden files starting with '.'
**flag : pwn.college{Yx50Dc49JPbLdjNEX8jZXD-DNNV.dBTN4QDLwUTO0czW}**

## An epic filesystem quest 
It was a series of clues which you had to find using commands we learnt earlier.

## making directories 
Here we use the mkdir command to make new directories. we create a drectory and file in it and run /challenege/run to get the flag 
**flag: pwn.college{0xNe6ItPt9wLIp5EG0jML48YPxL.dFzM4QDLwUTO0czW}**

## finding files
Here we learn about the find command and use it to find the flag. i first changed my directory to '/' and used the find command.

## Linking Files
Here we learn about linking files and fool the /challenge/catflag into giving us the flag.
